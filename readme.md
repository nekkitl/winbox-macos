# WinBox 3.40 on MacOS
This is simply packaged latest version of WinBox with Wine 9.7 64-bits, which just works.
Added new clear Mikrotik company icon and created association with `.wbx` files (+ icon)

Path for manual executable update:
```
./Winbox.app/Contents/Resources/application/winbox64.exe
```
